==================
Towers of Hanoi for IOS w/ Autosolve
==================

This game is created in Spritekit and is a basic implementation of towers of hanoi with an autosolve feature.
It took about 4 hours to create and design, but it is a good example of how to use 
breadth first search to solve basic problems. The autosolve feature solves it based on the current position 
of the disks on the pegs.

How to play:
1.Tap the peg with the desired disk to move.
2.Then tap the peg of the desired disk position.
3.Tap the background at any point to get the computer to autosolve it.
  Note: It may take a couple of seconds for the correct moves to be processed

•Stacks
•Queues
